# MarketRiskLesson
In 2019 this repository was created to host the notebooks for the exercises of a market risk lesson held by me at different universities.

2019. This repository contains two notebooks:
1-Hedging => hedging of a digital option
2-Frontier => building a Markowitz frontier, and analysing some aspects
3-VarExample => an example of VaR calculation (in parametric and historical approaches)
Notice: the workbooks do not work any more... I do not mantain them any more

2021. This repository contain one notebook only
1-Exercises_2021 => VaR calculation, backtesting and hedging.
