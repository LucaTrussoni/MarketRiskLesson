# MarketRiskLesson
In 2019 this repository was created to host the notebooks for the exercises of market risk lesson held at LUISS.
The repository is here to allow students to load them in binder and execute the exercises.

2019. This repository contains two notebooks:
1-Hedging => hedging of a digital option
2-Frontier => building a Markowitz frontier, and analysing some aspects
3-VarExample => an example of VaR calculation (in parametric and historical approaches)
Notice: the workbooks do not work any more... I do not mantain them any more

2021. This repository contain one notebook only
1-Exercises_2021 => VaR calculation, backtesting and hedging.
